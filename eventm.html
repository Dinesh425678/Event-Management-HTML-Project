            Event management is the application of project management to the creation and development of small and/or large-scale personal or corporate events such as festivals, conferences, ceremonies, weddings, formal parties, concerts, or conventions.To an attendee, a successful event means a seamless, inspiring, memorable, and/or value-added experience. To a meeting planner, a successful event means achieving these goals and more. At Castle, our role is to make events appear effortless.
